// Ever since you arrived at the Dojo, you wanted one of those cool Coding Dojo sweatshirts - maybe
// even more than one. Let's say they cost $20 (including tax), but friendly Josh gives a 9% discount if you
// buy two, a nice 19% discount if you buy three, or a sweet 35% discount if you buy four or more. He only
// accepts cash and says he doesn't have coins, so you should round up to the nearest dollar. Build
// function sweatshirtPricing(num) that, given a number of sweatshirts, returns the cost.
