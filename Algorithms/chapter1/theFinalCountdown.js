//This is based on "Flexible Countdown". the parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is
//essentially identical; don't be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1, param2, param3, param4),
//print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception:
//if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don't print) that one. Do this using a WHILE.
//Given (3,5,17,9), print 6, 12, 15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, excluding 9).
