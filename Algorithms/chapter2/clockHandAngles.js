// Regardless of how hard a Dojo student works (and they should work hard), they need time now and
// then to unwind - like hands on a clock. Traditional clocks are increasingly uncommon, but most can still
// read an analog clock's hands of hours, minutes and seconds. Create clockHandAngles(seconds)
// that, given a number of seconds since 12:00:00, prints angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and
// second hands. As review, 360 degrees form a full rotation. For input of 3600 secs (equivalent to
// 1:00:00), print "Hour hand: 30 degs. Minute hand: 0 degs. Second hand: 0 degs."
// For an input parameter seconds of 119730 (which is equivalet to 9:15:30 plus 24 hours!), you should
// log "Hour hand: 277.745 degs. Minute hand: 93 degs. Second hand: 180 degs."
// Note: in the second example, the angle for the minute hand is not simply 90 degrees; it has advanced a
// bit further, because of the additional 30 seconds in that minute so far.

// Second: also calculate and print degrees for an additional "week hand" that rotates once each week.
